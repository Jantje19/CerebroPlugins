# Notes
Lets you create notes in the [Cerebro](https://cerebroapp.com) environment.

**Notes only stay as long as the package is not updated or Cerebro is active!**

### Commands
The main command, *Notes* (incasesensitive), shows all notes by default. You can add these modifiers:
- add: Adds a note. The first argument will be the title and everything after that will become the content.
- edit (id): When a valid id is given it will update the note the same way as you would create it. When an invalid id is given a new note is created. 
- search: Searches through all notes by the id, title, content and date.

**Pressing the *delete* key on your keyboard when a note is highlighted will prompt to delete.**
